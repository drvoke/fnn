FNN is a script for Python 2.7 that allows you to post a tweet from the command line.

It requires passlib(https://pythonhosted.org/passlib/), PyCrypto(https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/), and the python-twitter API(https://github.com/bear/python-twitter) to function.  It's not very good, but I'm new to programming so I wanted to roll my own for my own educational purposes.

Use at your own risk.  It stores hashes of your twitter API credentials locally, and I'm by no means a computer security expert so it's probably not "safe" in any way.  This software and its source code are public domain.
